# Extendi website

## Getting Started

* Clone the project from this repository
* Run "yarn install" to install dependencies
* Run "yarn start" to start the development server
* **Optional** Install the reccomended vs code extensions

**N.B** Husky is used to check to run code checks on pre commit hook, if you have errors with external GUI tools like source tree run this command "husky install && echo "export PATH=\"$(dirname $(which node)):\$PATH\"" > ~/.huskyrc".
